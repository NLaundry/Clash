# Team Play Notes

Notes On how we can improve as a team

* Goals:
    * Communcation:
        * Chris early-mid game shotcalling:
            * Become a more prominent voice.
        * Be more decisive:
            * Call shots quickly and effectively
            * Follow up whether or not you think it's a good idea
        * Team fight communication:
            * Pre Teamfight:
                * Announce summs and big abilities/actives
                * Check carries and ask "do I peel or dive backlines?"
            * Mid Teamfight:
                * Announce plays just before you make them "I'm braum ulting their backline"
                * Check your carries "Do I need to peel? Am I out of place?"
            * Post Teamfight:
                * Announce what you do next (Take neutral objective, reset, etc.)
        * Keep communication up even when you're behind:
            * We tend to stop communicating when we fall behind
            * The best way to get back into the game is to keep communicating
        * Communicate the Wincon:
            * After each big moment (fight, dragon, etc) discuss a wincon and play to it.
        * Communicate Both Junglers positions at all times
        * Announce which lane the jungler is ganking "I'm coming to you" < "I'm coming top lane"
    * Draft:
        * Practice new teamcomps
        * Know the wincons of each team comp (do we engage as 5, look to split, etc)
        * Knowing lane counters
        * Know the strengths of the opponents draft
    * Vision:
        * Ward - stops us from losing
        * Deward - snowballs us
    * Game Knowledge:
        * We should all work on having a better understanding of what plays should happen next:
            * Taking dragons, rotations, macro play in general
